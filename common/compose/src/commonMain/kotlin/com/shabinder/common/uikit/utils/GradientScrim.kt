/**
 * Draws a vertical gradient scrim in the foreground.
 *
 * @param color The color of the gradient scrim.
 * @param startYPercentage The start y value, in percentage of the layout's height (0f to 1f)
 * @param endYPercentage The end y value, in percentage of the layout's height (0f to 1f)
 * @param decay The exponential decay to apply to the gradient. Defaults to `1.0f` which is
 * a linear gradient.
 * @param numStops The number of color stops to draw in the gradient. Higher numbers result in
 * the higher visual quality at the cost of draw performance. Defaults to `16`.
